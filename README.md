## Getting started
Fundamentals folder includes the main structures of computer vision with nice examples.\
Inside of fundamentals you will see the DATA folder which contains images required by examples.\
At project section, there is a good way of making counter for fingers in real time.\
Of course, after understanding these milestones, you should go through deep learning.

### Why Deep Learning ?
Deep learning is one of the main part of computer vision because life is not linear at all so we are mostly needed neural networks to analyse and solve our problems.\
Feel free to check the Deep Learning repo to find Customized Neural Networks, YOLOv3 in TF/Keras - PyTorch and more.
